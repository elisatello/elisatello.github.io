<strong>Eli</strong>

<p>
Eli is the goddess of whimsy and voice of the band. She hails from Caracas, Venezuela but was raised in Bogota, Colombia for most of her life. Singing was natural for her as her mother is a musician as well, and she taught her how to sing as well as the art of whimsy. The first and most whimsical moment in her life was her first performance, she sang and danced to Christmas music in front of her family. Truly a rare being.

<strong>Γεώργιος</strong>
</h3>
<hr/>
GEORGIOS, born from the earth herself, is a master of frequency but NOT volume, thus part of a meta band. He has no degrees whatsoever having been born with anything there is to know (besides dynamics). Has a built-in compressor turning everything he plays all the way up to avoid any “soft” sounding dynamics. In his early 2000s’ he met with the rest of the band and from then he did not let them go. They have toured many countries, blown almost all speakers that have played which is why they have almost no income. They live by photosynthesis and from self-grown crops. Career highlights include: Being an important experimentation aspect for earplug research at Harvard, Guinness world record for longest lasting tour 597 years, First concert to obstract radio frequencies with sound waves(is that even possible?)
