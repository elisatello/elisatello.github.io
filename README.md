## Band Website 

- We decided on a name for the band: GODSBAND
- We made a google doc to edit the code and fix issues in the same place. 
- We copied the first part of the html code from last week's class sample websites. 
- we wrote in the formatting for each bio paragraph and header as well as the website header. 
- We each wrote bios for each member while hayden looked for images and gifs to add to our website. 
- George added some styling and formatting tags so that it looks better. 
- Andrew wrote code for an audio player but it didn't work. 


##Problems faced:

- We had some trouble with the header formatting, but we were putting different header tags for each bio when we could use the same so that's what we did.
- css file wasn't linking properly with the file in the folder. We copied the css line and the file from the website example. 

##Self Assesment: 
- I wrote my bio paragraph and helped with the organization of the code so it was easier to understand in the google doc. 
- I wrote the CSS file, borrowing from the sample website, and editing it so it had tge colors, fonts and font sizes we wanted. 
- Fixed formatting issues we were having with the headers and the index not linking back to the css file. 

## Peer Assesment: 
- George wrote most of the html code and formatting, Andrew added hroizontal rulers and breaks to keep the website organized, they each also wrote a bio paragraph to add to the page. 
- Hayden helped a lot with references for the css file as well as looking for the images we used in the webpage. 
- Andrew also wrote js code for an audio player but we couldnt get it to work on the web page.
